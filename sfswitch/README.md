# Salesforce Switch

Django application designed to run on Heroku for disabling and enabling Salesforce automations (Workflows, Process Flows, Validation Rules and Triggers)

## Setup

To set this up on your own Heroku account, this app does require some knowledge of deploying Django apps. The following Heroku apps are required:
- Heroku Postgres (or alternative database)
- Redis To Go (or Heroku Redis - but might require some minor changes)
